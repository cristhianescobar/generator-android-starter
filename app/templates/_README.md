## Frameworks

The app is built atop a collection of awesome Android libraries by (Square)[http://square.github.io/]
using a single Activity/multiple view style.

* (Dagger - dependency injection)[http://google.github.io/dagger]
* (Mortar - composable, scoped modules)[https://github.com/square/mortar]
* (Flow - sane navigation)[https://github.com/square/flow]
* (Retrofit - type-safe REST client)[https://github.com/square/retrofit]

A solid understanding of these is essential before getting started.

## Unit Tests

Robolectric is used to run tests in the JVM (much faster). JaCoCo is used for code coverage reporting.

To run all tests and output coverage reports:

```bash
$ ./gradlew cleanTest jacocoTestReport --info
```

Generated test reports can be found in: `<app_dir>/app/build/reports/jacoco/jacocoTestReport/html/index.html`
